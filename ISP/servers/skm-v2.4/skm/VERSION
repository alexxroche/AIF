Forked from version:
---------------------- 
skm-20081121 - on Nov 21, 2008 1:28 PM

Reason for this fork
----------------------
- fixing root user issue (change from root user to sudo)
- enhance SKM to create accounts on a remote host!
- ease up my life for activating the use of the great Backup software 'BackupPC'

Why is LSKUM named LSKUM?
-------------------------
LSKUM = Linux SSH-Key & User Management

Ok, but why 'LSKUM' and not: [fill-in-what-you-want] ?

Because ...
... SKM is not enough anymore (doesn't point to the new user management function)
... SKUM is a name/word used in several other products/sites..
... SUKM is not the right name because the 'K' means Key and is related to SSH

... LSKUM is nowhere mentioned else in the web (so we can use it and no confusion/mix-up possible)
... LSKUM stands for everything the tool can do for you
... LSKUM can be spoken easily ;o)
