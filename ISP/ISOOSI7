Application (Layer 7)
This layer supports application and end-user processes.
Telnet and FTP are applications that exist entirely in the application level.

Presentation (Layer 6)
This layer provides independence from differences in data representation (e.g., encryption) It is sometimes called the syntax layer.

Session (Layer 5)
This layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between
applications. The session layer sets up, coordinates, and terminates
conversations, exchanges, and dialogues between the applications at
each end.

Transport (Layer 4)
This layer provides transparent transfer of data between end
systems, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery
and flow control. It ensures complete data transfer.

Network (Layer 3)
This layer provides switching and routing technologies and virtual circuits. Routing and forwarding are functions of this layer, congestion control and packet sequencing.

Data Link (Layer 2)
At this layer, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits. The data link layer is divided into two sublayers:
The Media Access Control (MAC) layer and the 
Logical Link Control (LLC) layer. 

Physical (Layer 1) electrical impulse Fast Ethernet, RS232, and ATM protocols
