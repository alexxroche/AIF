    <ul>
     <li>
        It would be nice if $.ajax({port: 143, protocol: imap, host: imap4.example.net}); but It can't, (due to domain limitations enforced in the browser.)
    </li>
    <li>
    It is possible to write a javascript engine that didn't have this limitation, but that would add the vulnerability that is, (mostly) being avoided by domain limitations, (*cough* XSS ).
    </li><li>
    WebSockets offer more power but still require a URI. So an imap server, (like dovecot) /could/ offer a ws:// API, ( but that isn't the unix way - do one thing and do it well - if you want an ws:// API then write one and point it at dovecot.
    </li><li>
       <ul>
        <li>
        Using http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/ it would be possible to open any webmail in a frame and watch for encrypted messages.
        <li>
        With localstorage in browsers it would be possible to store public keys
        <li>
        With https://github.com/alexxroche/gibberish-aes it would be possible to encrypt a private key before storing it in the browser
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>  
        This is what jsImap is trying to do.
