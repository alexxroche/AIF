Steps to get this working:

1. Contact Alexx Roche for permission and your user key.

2. Install a web server, (if you don't already have one.)

 This might seem like an odd thing, but because of certain web-browser security
 measures, local files do not mix with http, which is needed for authentication.

 You can pick on of the following: {
    http://en.wlmp-project.net/downloads.php?cat=lighty
    https://github.com/valenok/mongoose
    http://portableapps.com/apps/development/xampp
 }
  or anything else that can server up html via http.

    You MUST run in on port 80, which may require admin rights.

3. Get this code

    Well you can clone it from github.com/alexxroche or just this directory

4. Install code

    Where ever the files are served from, by your web-server, create a directory, (folder in windows speak) called sites.
    In sites create a directory called github... carry on until you have:
        http://localhost/sites/github/AIF/scripts/html/soundcloud/group-cycle/
    and then put the contents of this directory in group-cycle.

5. Just use it.

    If your computer does not like localhost then edit your hosts file.
