A few commands that you might find hard to search for. 
Most of these are "..and so much more"

|    - THE unix linker
ab   - apache benchmark
awk  - ps auwxf|awk '{print $NF}' 
bc   - An arbitrary precision calculator language
curlftpfs - mount a remote filesystem over ftp
dd   - disk to disk copy
df   - disk free? 
du   - directory usage
dig  - DNS query tool
find - a lot more useful that you might think
git  - now my VCS of choice
grep - match
ip a - (replaces ifconfig)
host - replaces nslookup
ls   - list the contense of a directory
mtr  - Matts Tracreroute
nc   - use to test network-server
netstat -pan
od   - octal dump (shows you what is REALLY there)
ps   - process list
sed  - she what
screen- how many night did I dream of this?
ssh  - ~/.ssh/config
sort - u
tee  - send output to two locations
time - see how long something takes to run
tree - a graphical ls
tmux - terminal multiplexor (like screen)
vi   - I use vim
w    - who
watch - have a guess

This list could be a lot larger, (I have over 3500 programs in various /[s]bin/)
but these are the ones that I either took too long to find or had a,
"Why didn't anyone tell me about..." moment.
