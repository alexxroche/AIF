say we have a UUID of 89a6fdac-acef-11e1-a4dd-00188bba79ac and want to search the rest of the document for it.
Good news: your mouse just broke. No highlighting for you.
Here is how:

Esc
?89a
y7w
/^r0

and that is it. 

Esc     # into visual-mode
?89a    # seach back to the start of the string. We just as well have used /89a6 if we were at the start of this file
y7w     # yank 7 words (a uuid has seven parts) Hint: if your string goes to the end of the line you can just do y$
/^r0    # here is the science: search using the last yanked object

^r is Ctrl+r (and may show a " (double quotes) when you press it)

Why does this work with vim? Because the last thing that you yank is put into the 0 register.

Read http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#registers for more info.

Remember: Learn just one new vim trick each day and you quickly become vi-mazing!

p.s. Stop using the arrow keys! It just slows you down.
p.p.s  Well found! 89a6fdac-acef-11e1-a4dd-00188bba79ac
