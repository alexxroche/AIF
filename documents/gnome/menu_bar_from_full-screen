I spent most of my time in terminal, and in full screen. ( I have a small laptop and need all the screen that I can get. I also use screen and tmux.)

I set up keyboard shortcuts for everything that I need, (mostly Ctrl+Alt+Home to toggle play/pause on Rhythembox) but sometimes I need the menu bar.
I /do/ have Alt+Enter to toggle full-screen but sometimes you don't want that so...

Ctrl+Alt-Tab  Ah-haaaaa! A slightly odd hand position but very occasionally useful.
