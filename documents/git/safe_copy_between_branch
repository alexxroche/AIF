# So you want to copy all files from a messed up branch (main) into a backup branch (arch)

git co arch;
for i in `git diff arch..main --stat|grep '|'|grep -Ev "\-$"|awk '{print $1}'`; do ls $i 2>/dev/null| git co main -- $i; done

# this will copy over any files that do not exists in the arch branch. 
# You should consider creating a third branch from arch and `git merge main`
