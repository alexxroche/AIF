If you only have ftp access to a remote server and do not want to mirror the whole site then curlftpfs is your friend:

Just run the following as root, (you might have to install curlftpfs first), to "mount" the remote site on /media/cfs
(you can change the mount point to suit you.) It will, obv. not be as fast as local access but if you only need to 
hack one or two files, or local disk-space is an issue, then this might be the way.

# curlftpfs -o allow_other ftp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@IP_OR_HOSTNAME /media/cfs
