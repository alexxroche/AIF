1. Starting

    Firstly choose your portrait – the less detail in the photograph the better the results!
    Open in GIMP
    Duplicate Original 4 times
    Then Add Alpha Channel to all layers

2. Threshold (~ = APPROX.)

    On First layer – Go, Colors –> Threshold
    Set to ~25 as shown:
    REPEAT for each layer:
    Second Layer: set to ~50
    Third Layer: set to ~100
    Fourth Layer: set to ~130

3. Blur (This will make it smoother) (~ = APPROX.)

    Now, for all layers again:
    Go, Filters –> Blur –> Gaussian Blur
    Set to ~2.00, ~2.00 (any more and they’ll be large white outlines later)
    (Speed up the process by selecting your layer –>go, Filters –> Repeat ‘Guassian Blur’ , Ctrl F)

4. Remove Background

    Grab the Selection Tool
    Select the parts you don’t want to include:
    Delete them from all layers (keep selection, then select layer – Press Delete)
    The most detail will be on the Fourth Layer:

5. Delete the rest

    Grab the Color Selection Tool
    Select the white parts of each layer
    Press Delete (You need to select the white parts for each layer, otherwise you’ll delete other things)

6. Adding Colour

    Select Layer – Right Click –> Alpha to Selection
    First layer: Strip Pattern (download my version here) (goes in Pattern Folder of GIMP Folder)
    For the Strips to fit nicely you may need to scale down the image(~350) or edit the .pat file!
    Apply a little blur if you like!

    Select Layer – Right Click –> Alpha to Selection
    Second Layer: Creamy Colour: fbde90 (or you could use a Light Blue: 0087a1)
    Settings as shown: (remember Fill Whole Selection)

    Select Layer – Right Click –> Alpha to Selection
    Third Layer: Red Colour: 820606 (or for a brighter red e7000a)
    Settings as shown: (remember Fill Whole Selection)

    Select Layer – Right Click –> Alpha to Selection
    Fourth Layer: Blue Colour: 004754
    Settings as shown: (remember Fill Whole Selection)

7. Background Part 1

    Create a new Layer:
    Grab the Selection Tool
    Go round the edges just slightly in off the edge, as shown:
    Now, Fill the selection with the Blue Colour: 004754
    Then use the Selection Tool again, but select one half (right), fill with Red Colour: 820606 (or for a brighter red e7000a)

7b. Background Part 2

    Now, go Image –> Canvas Size
    Adjust so it is slightly wider and the length is increased to fit some text (‘HOPE’)

8. Move

    Now, go Right Click (on a layer) –> Merge Visible Layers
    Then centre the layer in the middle-top, as shown:
    Now create a new Layer and fill with a Creamy Colour: fcdf91

9. Add Text ‘HOPE’

    Use the Text Tool
    Whatever word you’d like underneath? (‘HOPE’)
    Use Text: Franklin Gothic Demi
    Size: ~180
    If there is excess length or width just crop away!


10. Adjusting Colours

    If you’d like to experiment with colours, just Right Click (on a layer) –> Merge Visible Layerd
    Then, go Colors –> Hue-Saturation
