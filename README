AIF - Alexx' Information Files
(Things people ask for or search for; often that person is me.) 

Over the years I found myself, (as I imagine many people do), 
searching for information. There are times when that search
was either hard or had exexpected results. If the result was
me thinking, "I should make a note of that" then it was added
here.

This started back in '94 with notes on something called HTML.

Many years later I have found that http://www.commandlinefu.com
http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/notify and http://stackoverflow.com/ 
cover most things that I need, but some of these examples are 
still easier for me to find as I have used them so many times. 


http://www.wikipedia.org, https://www.google.com/ncr and 
http://senseis.xmp.net/ solve all of my other searches.
