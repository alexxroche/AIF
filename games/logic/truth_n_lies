This is a classic: I have found my way to the top of the tallest tower in a castle.
There are two doors and one guard in front of each door. One guard always lies and the other always tells the truth.
Behind one door is the treasure that I'm looking for. Behind the other door is some pain that I do not want.
Once I pick a door and go through the guards will lock the door behind me. The treasure room has a parachute 
and a window so that I can escape. I do NOT know which guard lies and which tells the truth, and if I ask
more than one question both guards will kill me.

What question do I ask and to which guard?

















This is a fun one because there IS a factually correct answer.


The first thing to notice is that because we do not know which guard is which the one question that we
ask has to work with either guard.



What if I ask, "Is the door behind you the door to the treasure?"

There are four possible situations.

a. I'm asking the honest guard and he is in front of the treasure.
b. I'm asking the honest guard and he is in front of the pain.

c. I'm asking the liar and he is in front of the treasure.
d. I'm asking the liar and he is in front of the pain.


So this simple question fails for c. and d.


If my one question is: 
"If I asked the other guard, does this door lead to the treasure, would he say yes?"

What are the replies and depending on the replies what would my actions be?




























"If I asked the other guard, does this door lead to the treasure, would he say no?"

a. I'm asking the honest guard and he is in front of the treasure: reply:yes, action: pick that door
b. I'm asking the honest guard and he is in front of the pain:  reply: no, action: pick the other door

c. I'm asking the liar and he is in front of the treasure: reply: no, action: pick the other door
d. I'm asking the liar and he is in front of the pain:  reply: yes, action: pick that door.
