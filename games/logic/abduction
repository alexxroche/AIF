10 people abducted by aliens to be tested.
Each lined up in a row so that they can not move. The person at the back can see the back of all of the 9 in front.
The person at the front can see only the wall.

Each person has a black or white ribbon pinned to their back by the aliens. Starting with person 10 they ask
what is the colour of the ribbon on your back?

If he is right he lives, if he is wrong he dies. He can only say one word, either black or white.

What system do the 10 people use to ensure that 9 live?












ANSWER: 

Each says the colour of the ribbon of the next person. Person 10 has a 50:50 chance, but all the rest have a 100% chance.
This is false. The right answer is;

The 10th person count the number of white hats. If he sees an odd number then he says white. If he sees an even number
he says black.
The 9th person counts the number of white hats. If he sees an odd number then he is wearing a black hat.
Each person must remember how many people have guessed white. Each time they toggle their reply.
